# Practice Routine

- vim
  - [ ] finish vim tutor, run `vimtutor` from cli (not from inside vim)
  - [ ] spelling suggestions with `z=`. This is a builtin in vim but hijacked by `whichkey` in our setup
- flash
  - [ ] start using labelled search
  - [x] start using jump labels, `s`
  - [ ] start using treesitter selection `S`
    - it only suggest object upward and not downward from selection
    - `;` and `,` in this behave weird
  - [ ] start using `yR` (Treesitter Search). This is super cool
  - [ ] start using `yr` (remote mode). This is even more cooler
    - it is three step: initiate, goto, perform. After initiate and goto, you are already in operator pending mode.
    - examples
      - yank text without loosing cursor
        - press `yr` to initiate
        - find i.e. look where you want to go and type few characters
        - perform any motion, like iw or even start flash Treesitter with S
        - the yank will be performed on the new selection
        - you'll be back in the original window / position
- neotree
  - [ ] get in practice of using all three, `<leader>` `fe`, `ge` and `be` commands. They can also be toggled while you
        are in neotree window by pressing `>` and `<`
- mini.surround
  - [ ] surround
    - [ ] surround word - `gsaiw` is mapped to `<leader>iw`. Get used to it
    - [ ] surround word interactively - `gsaiw?` is mapped to `<leader>iW`. Get used to it
  - [ ] practice replace surroundings - `gsr`
  - [ ] find and move to next surrounding - `gsf`, find last - `gsfl`
  - [ ] practice with function calls, the keyword is `f`. So `gsrlf(` will replace last function call with bracket `(`
- textobjects
  - [ ] incremental selection with `<c-space>` and `backspace`
  - text objects
    - [ ] brackets can also be selected with a generic selector `b`
    - [ ] quotes can also be selected with a generic selector `q`
    - [ ] opening brackets are different from closing in how they treat space, see `:h MiniAi-textobject-builtin`
    - [ ] custom prompt with `?`
    - [ ] tag with `t`
    - [ ] underscore
    - [ ] digit with `d`
    - [ ] word in camelcase of snakecase with `e`
    - [ ] sentence with `s` and paragraph with `p`
    - [ ] next or last text objects with `n` and `l`
    - [ ] function is `f`
    - [ ] indent with `i`
    - [ ] class is `c`
    - [ ] arguments is `a`
    - [ ] block, conditional or loop with `o`
    - [ ] fn call with u and U
    - [ ] comments with `/`
    - [ ] variable assignment with with `v`, `a` capture full, `i` capture the side you are on
    - [ ] lhs of variable assignment with with `y`, as in `y = x`
    - [ ] rhs of variable assignment with with `x`, as in `y = x`
  - move with `[`, `]` (treesitter text_objects plugin) and `g[`, `g]` around objects (mini.ai)
    - [ ] goto next, previous (start and end) of text objects with `[` and `]`
    - [ ] goto next and previous reference of word under cursor in code with `]]` and `[[`
    - [ ] you can navigate "around" all mini text objects using `g[` and `g]`. Notice that this is to move around
          objects and not to next or last
  - [ ] select all above text objects
  - [ ] swap for functions and arguments using `<leader>m`
